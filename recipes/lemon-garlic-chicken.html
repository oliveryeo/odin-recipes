        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a keto-friendly and low-carb chicken thigh packed with tangy lemon and garlic flavour!</p>
        <p>Recipe is taken from: <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/272859/keto-lemon-garlic-chicken-thighs-in-the-air-fryer/">https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/272859/keto-lemon-garlic-chicken-thighs-in-the-air-fryer/</a></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>0.25 cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>0.25 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>0.125 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
            <li>4 lemon wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Set marinade aside.</li>
            <li>Place chicken thighs into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour marinade over chicken and seal bag, making sure to cover all parts of chicken. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken pieces in the air fryer basket, cooking in batches if necessary.</li>
            <li>Fry until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 22 to 24 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Squeeze a lemon wedge over each piece upon serving.</li>
        </ol>
