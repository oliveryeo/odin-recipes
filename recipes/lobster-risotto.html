        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Have you ever watched Hell's kitchen? Hell yeah that's where I found out what a Risotto is! Today I will attempt to cook a creamy and rich risotto with lobseter, caramelized onions, and sherry. Hopefully I won't be Gordon Ramsay's idiot sandwich!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>0.25 cup olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
            <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 shallot, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1.5 cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li>0.5 cup white wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup light cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>0.25 cup sherry</li>
            <li>2 cups cooked lobster meat</li>
            <li>0.5 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until light brown and tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring chicken broth to a boil in a pot; reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large, flat-bottom pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shallot and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add Arborio rice to shallot mixture; cook and stir until rice begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add wine and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir 1 cup chicken broth into rice mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until broth is absorbed. Repeat adding broth, 1 cup at a time, until all the broth is used, stirring constantly until broth is absorbed each time, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix honey into onions and cook 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Stir butter into rice mixture until melted. Add cream and stir until rice mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Add paprika and cayenne pepper; stir well. Add sherry and mix well. Stir lobster meat into rice mixture and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Mix Parmesan cheese into rice mixture until melted. Add onion mixture and mix well; season with salt and pepper.</li>
